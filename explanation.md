### Ansible Instrumentation Steps
- Create a directory for the project mkdir ansible-IP
- cd ansible-IP
- Create a custom Vagrantfile using the geerlingguy/ubuntu2004 image
#### Disable SSH host keys checking
- Create a hosts file with the IP addresses of the client, backend and database virtual machines 
- Display SSH configs using the command vagrant ssh-config and note the port, IdentityFile and user
- Create ansible.cfg file 
  - Provide the security settings using the information from the vagrant ssh-config command. 
  - Disable host key checking by typing host_key_checking = False in the file

#### Provision the servers 
- Create the playbook.yaml file that ansible will use to provision the servers listed in the hosts file. 
- Edit the Vagrantfile to use Ansible to provision the servers by adding the below just before the end
  ###### Ansible provisioning.
  config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
    ansible.playbook = "playbook.yaml"
  end

#### Create the virtual servers
- Run the following vagrant commands in the terminal:
  - vagrant up
  - vagrant provision < vm-instance-name > (incase it does not automatically start the playbook)
  - vagrant status - confirm that all virtual machines are running

#### Start the backend server
- Login to the backend server and start the PM2 service, for some reason Ansible is not able to start it automatically.
- vagrant ssh backend
- cd backend
- pm2 start --name yolo_app npm -- start
- pm2 list (confirm if the app is online)
